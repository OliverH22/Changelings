        right: `<h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>Police investigation hit a dead end in a case of repeated break-ins with no signs of entry. The break-ins occured in the home of a family of 3, and the perpetrator always enters the child’s room. After several unsuccessful attempts to catch the perpetrator, The parents contacted me,
            believing the break-ins to be the work of a magical creature.  I was brought in to identify the creature and find a method to capture or repel it.</p>
        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>When I arrived at the home, I questioned the family to find any details on the creature. Only the child provided useful information,
            as they were the only ones to see it. They described it as a boogeyman, a generic term for creatures that seek out sleeping children for various purposes.
            They told me it was a tall, dark human shaped figure, but it did not appear to do anything, just watch the child as they slept. At this point I knew vaguely what it looked like, and that it was intelligent enough to hide when other humans were approaching. My abilities could give me a clearer picture of the creature, but I would need to be in the room when it appeared, which is impossible. This was not enough to determine a specific creature, so over the next 3 weeks I gathered more information. Eventually, I had a breakthrough when I noticed the child was becoming more lethargic, and had lower emotional responses. While they could be explained by sleep disruptions, I believe they are the creatures doing. This would make it an emotional feeder, similar to the Baku.
            This feeding behavior means the child is not in imminent danger, but harm could be done if the creature is not removed.</p>                
        <h3>Result:</h3>
        <p>Case was handed off to an expert in expelling creatures that have become attached to homes. Full resolution of the case is pending, but my investigation was successful.</p>`

        <img id="caseImg" src="images/AureliaSiteImages/polaroid_flat2.png" alt="PlantImage">
        <h3>Name: The Neuro-Carnivorous Plant</h3>
        <h3>Status: Resolved</h3>`,
        right: `<h3>Background:</h3>
        <p>I was contacted by a nursery owner who was suffering from intense nightmares. After a few of his employees started noticing the same effects,
            he suspected magical interference. I was hired to find and eliminate the source of the nightmares.</p>
        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p> Upon arrival, I asked the affected employees about the nature of the nightmares, and how long they had been experiencing them. As stated on the phone call, all of the employees started experiencing nightmares after the owner. This suggests he is the vector for some kind of “dream virus”, or that he is some kind of impostor that induces nightmares. My next step was to enter someone’s nightmare, and see if I can discover the source from within. I didn’t entirely trust the owner, so I asked one of the employees if they could fall asleep. While I waited, I searched the shop for any items or symbols or signs of creatures. 
        When I woke inside the dream, I was inside of a small, dark room, probably a closet but it was completely empty. It was also completely silent,
        no birds,cars or even wind. Regular nightmares have action, something is actively affecting the person who is experiencing them. Something seems to be draining the experience out of this dream - perhaps it was not even a nightmare to begin with. Once outside of the closet,
        I was in an otherwise normal apartment, but it was completely overgrown. Inside the building was the employee whose dream I was currently inside. She seemed to be stuck in the plant, even fused with it in some places. I tried to reassure her, but quickly moved on to investigate the building. I noticed the plants were growing from below the building, so I followed them down into the basement. There was a massive vine breaking through the floor, extending up from a void below. I decided to follow the vine down to its source, which seemed to take hours - dreams can warp perceptions of time. Eventually I reached the nursery, floating in the void. I think this is some kind of nexus, as there were more branches extending out into the void. The branches all converged in a bag of soil in storage, bursting out of the bag. I attempted various ways to destroy the branches,
        but they seem to be impervious to damage here. My efforts did have an effect however, waking up the employee and kicking me out with her.
        </p>
        <h3>Result:</h3>  
        <p>After my experience in the dream, we decided to check the storage room. Inside one of the soil bags we found a fully grown and healthy root system, with no leaves or stems.
            After removing and killing it, the worker’s dreams returned to normal. It seems this plant is some kind of mind parasite - sucking up experiences to feed itself.
            I have no idea where the plant came from, or how many more there are.</p>`

        <h3>Name: The Shape Shifter</h3>
        <h3>Status: Resolved</h3>`,
        right: `<h3>Background: </h3>
        <p>Hired by a pharmaceutical company intern to investigate a strange occurrence at their lab. Security cameras recorded a newly hired intern entering the facility after-hours.
            When questioned about why they entered, the intern claimed they did not, and no logs in the computer system show them entering the facility.
            The intern believes some kind of shapeshifter is framing her to prevent anyone from discovering it.</p>
            <h3>Summary: </h3>
            <p>When we first met, I first made sure she knew exactly how my powers worked. At that point, I suspected she did it and was trying to use magic to come up with a cover story.
            On contact, however, I found that she was telling the truth - she hadn’t left her apartment the night of the supposed break-in. Now that I knew she was telling the truth,
            the next obstacle was convincing her employer. The company will most likely not take the word of a dream walker on its own,
            so we’ve used the intern’s internet activity on that night, and her roommates testimony as additional evidence.</p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>The company seemed to accept our evidence, although it was not the deciding factor. The security footage showed the intern entering the building and walking directly towards the server room,
            and accessing one particular machine. They don’t believe it is possible for an intern hired a week ago to be that familiar with the building layout, so they are calling in an investigator of their own.
            My client is not longer under extreme suspicion, so unless she contacts me again, I will consider this case resolved.</p>`
