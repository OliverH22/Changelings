            <h3>Name: A Standard Boogeyman</h3>

            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>Police investigation hit a dead end in a case of repeated break-ins with no signs of entry. The break-ins occured in the home of a family of 3, and the perpetrator always enters the child‚Äôs room. After several unsuccessful attempts to catch the perpetrator, The parents contacted me,
                believing the break-ins to be the work of a magical creature.  I was brought in to identify the creature and find a method to capture or repel it.</p>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>When I arrived at the home, I questioned the family to find any details on the creature. Only the child provided useful information,
                as they were the only ones to see it. They described it as a boogeyman, a generic term for creatures that seek out sleeping children for various purposes.
                They told me it was a tall, dark human shaped figure, but it did not appear to do anything, just watch the child as they slept. At this point I knew vaguely what it looked like, and that it was intelligent enough to hide when other humans were approaching. My abilities could give me a clearer picture of the creature, but I would need to be in the room when it appeared, which is impossible. This was not enough to determine a specific creature, so over the next 3 weeks I gathered more information. Eventually, I had a breakthrough when I noticed the child was becoming more lethargic, and had lower emotional responses. While they could be explained by sleep disruptions, I believe they are the creatures doing. This would make it an emotional feeder, similar to the Baku.
                This feeding behavior means the child is not in imminent danger, but harm could be done if the creature is not removed.</p>                
            <h3>Result:</h3>
            <p>Case was handed off to an expert in expelling creatures that have become attached to homes. Full resolution of the case is pending, but my investigation was successful.</p>
